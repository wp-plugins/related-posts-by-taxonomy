This lightweight plugin provides a widget and shortcode to display related posts by taxonomies as links, full posts or excerpts. 

== Description ==

Choose from single or multiple taxonomies and search for related posts in multiple post types. Posts that have the most terms in common will display at the top (also ordered by date). It's easy to override the look of the widget or shortcode with a filter or by including your own templates in your theme. It's also possible to get the related posts by using a function in your theme template files.

For more information on how to use the plugin see the readme.html file in the plugin's /docs directory.

== Installation ==
* Unzip the <code>related-posts-by-taxonomy.zip</code> folder.
* Upload the <code>related-posts-by-taxonomy</code> folder to your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory.
* Activate *Related Posts by Taxonomy*.
* That's it, now you are ready to use the widget and shortcode
